Project 3: Sequential Logic is a comprehensive exploration of digital circuit design, focused on implementing and testing core sequential logic systems. In this project, I developed a series of sequential circuits that form the backbone of modern computing systems. Sequential logic differs from combinational logic in that it considers past inputs (i.e., its history) along with current inputs to determine its output. By designing flip-flops, registers, counters, and state machines, I gained hands-on experience with memory elements that store and transition data over time.


Throughout the project, I utilized hardware description languages to simulate and verify the behavior of these circuits. Emphasis was placed on ensuring timing accuracy and minimizing hazards in transitions between states. I also incorporated real-world testing using simulation tools, which allowed me to validate circuit performance and reliability under different operating conditions. This project not only deepened my understanding of sequential circuit design principles but also refined my problem-solving abilities in digital logic and state-based system implementations. It serves as a solid foundation for more advanced work in computer architecture and embedded system design, showcasing the critical role of sequential logic in effective hardware design.
